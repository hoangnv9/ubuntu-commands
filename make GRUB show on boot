# How to make GRUB always appear for Ubuntu

sudo vi /etc/default/grub  
 
Then when gedit loads, comment out (place a # in front) the following line:
 
GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=0  
 
Also set the following to a lower value if you want (3~5 seconds is reasonable):
 
GRUB_TIMEOUT=10  
 
Then save the file and in the Terminal issue the following command:
 
sudo update-grub
